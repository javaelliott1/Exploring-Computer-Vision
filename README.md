For the Intro to Machine Learning class

The goal of this project is to use two deep learning models to explore two domaisn of computer vision-emotion recognition and mask detection. These models could be applied to problems about disease spread/risk analysis, face recognition, and face verification.

We used feature extraction and fine tuning for both models to explore the gains and uses of transfer learning, and how it affects performance in terms of number of parameters, size, speed, and precision.

We posed some future possibilties in our research:
* Illumination in the images and how that may effect quality of output
* Grayscale's effect on output
* More diverse image dataset
* Model explainability using tf_explain
* Pose data augmentation
